# Caching System

A caching system is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. By storing data in a cache, the system can avoid having to fetch or compute the data again, thus improving the overall performance of the system.

## Caching Strategies

There are several caching strategies commonly used:

- FIFO (First-In-First-Out): The oldest data is removed when a new piece of data needs to be stored.
- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out): The most recently added data is removed when a new piece of data needs to be stored.
- LRU (Least Recently Used): The least recently used data is removed when a new piece of data needs to be stored.
- MRU (Most Recently Used): The most recently accessed data is removed when a new piece of data needs to be stored.
- LFU (Least Frequently Used): The least frequently used data is removed when a new piece of data needs to be stored.

## Purpose of Caching System

The purpose of a caching system is to improve the performance of a system by storing frequently accessed data, so that it can be retrieved quickly. This reduces the need to fetch the data from slower sources, such as disk drives or over a network.

## Limitations of Caching System

Caching systems have some limitations, including:

- Balancing cache size and speed: Larger caches can hold more data, reducing the need for retrieval from slower sources, but they are also slower to access.
- Memory limitations: There is a practical limit to the amount of memory that can be allocated for caching.
- Difficulty in predicting data access patterns: It is challenging to decide which data to keep in the cache and which to remove, as it is difficult to predict future data access patterns.
