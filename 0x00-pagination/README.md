# 0x00-pagination

This code implements pagination in a REST API.

Pagination is a technique used to divide a large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks called pages. It allows clients to retrieve data in smaller portions, improving performance and reducing network load.

To use pagination in a REST API, the following steps are typically involved:

1. Define the maximum number of items per page.
2. Implement a mechanism to retrieve a specific page of data.
3. Include pagination metadata in the API response, such as the total number of items, the current page, and the number of pages.
4. Provide links to navigate between pages, such as "next", "previous", and "first/last" links.

By implementing pagination, you can enhance the scalability and usability of your REST API, especially when dealing with large datasets.
